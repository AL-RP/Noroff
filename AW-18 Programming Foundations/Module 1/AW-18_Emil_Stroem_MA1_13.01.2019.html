    <h1>Programming Foundations Module Assignment 1</h1>
    <h2>Quick explenation</h2>
    <p>I decided to do assignment 5-9 in one single script.</p>
    <p>I hope this is an acceptable way to submit the assignment</p>
    <P>I wanted to challenge myself by seing if I could make the script select a random value from my array, but also display the possibilities like requested in the assignment.</p>

    var countries = ["Norway", "Sweeden", "Denmark", "Iceland", "Finland"];

    var country = countries[Math.floor(Math.random()*countries.length)];

    for(var i = 0; i<countries.length; i++) {
      console.log("The possible countries are as follows: "+ countries[i]+".");
    }

    if (country == "Norway") {
      console.log("The random country is Norway, Norway has a population of: POPULATION HERE")
